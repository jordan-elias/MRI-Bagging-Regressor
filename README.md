"A Bagging regressor is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits base regressors each on random subsets of the original dataset and then aggregate their individual predictions 
(either by voting or by averaging) to form a final prediction. Such a meta-estimator can typically be used as a way to reduce the variance of a black-box estimator 
(e.g., a decision tree), by introducing randomization into its construction procedure and then making an ensemble out of it."
